# My vim colorschemes

`Hello.vim` is inspired by NLKNguyen's [PaperColor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) dark theme.

If you'd like to test it, just put the file in your `.vim/colors` directory, and run the command `colorscheme hello`.
Add it to your `.vimrc` if you like!

If you prefer your terminal background, just run `hi Normal ctermbg=NONE`, or feel free to change the corresponding
line in the file.
